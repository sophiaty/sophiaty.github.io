        <p>
            I'm Yuan Tian and
            I'm an Assistant Professor in the School of Computing at Queen's University. Before joining Queen's, I was a
            data scientist at the Living Analytics Research Centre (LARC), Singapore Management University (SMU). I
            received my Ph.D. degree in Information Systems from SMU in May 2017 and a bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
            Chu Kochen Honors College of Zhejiang University in 2012. I visited Carnegie Mellon University in 2015 and Inria
            Paris in 2013.
        </p>
        <p>
            My research focuses on three domains: Data Mining, Software Engineering, and Social Science. My long-term
            research goal is to help people gain insights from messy data stored in all kinds of software repositories
            and
            propose context-aware data-driven approaches to improve the efficiency and capabilities of various
            stakeholders
            in software development process.

            I am looking for self-motivated master/PhD. students who are excited about data mining and software
            engineering.
